It will post a new tweet every 30 minutes, which has a 40% chance of mentioning a user, and a 75% chance of including a hashtag. Every 12 hours, the database of tweets will be refreshed and re-parsed to stay up to date.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n- [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)\r\n- [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify)\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n1. Clone the repository, or in some way get the code.\r\n2. Create a Twitter account to use for the script.\r\n3. Go to https://apps.twitter.com and create a new app. Fill in the information and find your consumer key and secret.\r\n4. Generate your access key and access secret below.\r\n5. Open up your favorite editor and make a new file called `credentials.py` and copy in the variables below.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nconsumer_key = \"Your_key\"\r\nconsumer_secret = \"Your_secret\"\r\naccess_key = \"Token_key\"\r\naccess_secret = \"Token_secret\"\r\n```\r\nReplace the values within the quotes with the appropriate values you just got from your Twitter app.\r\n6. *(Optional) If you want to use a different account than @realDonaldTrump, you just need to go into `main.py` and change all instances of `realDonaldTrump` to whatever username you would like to use.*\r\n\r\n### Running\r\nIn terminal, run `python main.py`\r\nDepending on how your system is configured, you may need to run it as root with `sudo python main.py`, which will prompt you for your password.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nIf you find a bug, know a better way of doing something, or want to add a feature, please feel free to open a pull request and I will take a look.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
